# 2023-ND-QuarkNet-CMS-Data
This is a repository housing work from Summer of 2023

Notes for using Importing, Analysing and Ploting CSV data.ipynb ...

1.  To use github to host .CSV files for use in a JupyterNotebooks, you click to view forthe "raw" file.  It will put "raw" into the html link.  Example "https://raw.githubusercontent.com ..." And this will easily read into JupyterNotebooks.

MuRun2010B.csv was added to repository to correct extra space in "px1" data column (listed as "px1 ".  The extra space prevented "pandas" python library command from drawing in the data correctly.

2.  To make Pandas work in the my_python container JupiterNotebook you can install Pandas Library with the command.  "pip install pandas"
this only needs to be done once.
